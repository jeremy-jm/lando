  #### A translation software that collects commonly used translation services without starting ads.
</div>

## Background

The author was tired of the startup ads on mobile platforms. With frequent and brief use, searching for words only takes a few seconds, but there are at least 5 seconds of ads every time the software is opened. That's why the author came up with the idea of ​​making a free, ad-free software.

## Introduction

A dictionary that integrates third-party services and is ad-free.

Currently in its first phase, it only integrates Youdao's services. Support for Bing, Google, and other AI translation tools will be added later.

Supports iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, and Linux.

Windows and Linux versions lack testing and are currently under development. 


## Getting Started

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/jeremy-jm/lando.git
 flutter pub get
 flutter rub xxx(platform)
 ```
